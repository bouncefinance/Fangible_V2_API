Update main content:

- Rewriting the paging interface for the Marketplace list and the brands list can effectively solve the problem of too much data being loaded slowly in a single request
  1. One、 Marketplace List
  2. Two、 Brand List
- The back-end data is optimized and integrated, and the key data can be obtained through an interface, without the need to do too much data integration work in the front end
